    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I am a detail-oriented IT professional with hands-on experience as a Network Operations Center (NOC) Analyst,
        focused on monitoring, incident response, and service stability. With a strong foundation in STEM and a growing
        skill set in networking, systems, and IT service management, I thrive in fast-paced environments where accuracy
        and clear communication matter.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m experienced in analyzing alerts, coordinating with internal teams, and documenting incidents to ensure timely
        resolution and minimal service impact. I continuously work on improving my technical skills, particularly in networking,
        APIs, and Python, while strengthening my understanding of ITIL v4 best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Driven by curiosity and consistency, I value learning, accountability, and teamwork—and I aim to grow into roles that
        allow me to contribute to reliable, scalable, and well-managed IT services.
