What is a Self-Closing Tag:
    A self-closing tag is an HTML tag that does not need a closing tag.
    It contains no inner content and closes itself.

    Unlike normal tags (<p> content </p>), self-closing tags stand alone.

Common Self-Closing Tags
Tag                     Purpose
<br>                    Line break
<hr>                    Horizontal rule (line)
<img>                   Display image
<input>                 Input field
<meta>                  Metadata
<link.                  External resources (CSS)

Important Notes:
- Self-closing tags cannot contain text or other elements
- They are often used for structure or input, not content.
- Don't add closing tags like </br> or </img>
