    What is HTML?
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
    It defines the structure of a webpage by using various elements and tags to define headings, 
    paragraphs, links, images, and other content. HTML is the backbone of the web, allowing browsers 
    to interpret and display content for users.

    Why is HTML important?
    HTML is the foundation of all web development.
        - HTML - Structure (content)
        - CSS - Style (design)
        - JavaScript - Behavior (functionality)
    Without HTML, web pages cannot exist.
