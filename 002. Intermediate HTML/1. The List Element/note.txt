An item list in HTML is used to display a list of related items in a clear and organized way.
HTML provides three main types of lists.

1. Unordered List (<ul>)
    Used when the order does NOT matter.
        - Displays items with bullets (*)
        - Common for menus, features, or shopping lists

    Structure:
        - <ul> -> unordered list
        - <li> -> list item

    Example use cases:
        - Website navigation
        - Grocery list
        - Movie genres
    

2. Ordered List(<ol>)
    Used when order DOES matter.
        - Displays items with numbers or letters
        - Good for steps or rankings.
    
    Structure:
        - <ol> -> oredered list
        - <li> -> list item
    
    Example use cases:
        - Instructions or steps
        - Top 10 rankings
        - Procedures

3. Description List (<dl>)
    Used for terms and their descriptions
    
    Structure:
        - <dl> -> description list
        - <dt> -> term
        - <dd> -> description

    Example use cases:
        - Glossary
        - FAQ definitions
        - Technical terms

Key Points to Remember
    - <li> can only be inside <ul> or <ol>
    - Lists help with readability and accessibility
    - Lists can be nested (list inside another list)
