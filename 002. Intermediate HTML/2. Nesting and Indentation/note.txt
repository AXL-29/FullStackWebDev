1. What is Nesting?
    - Nesting means putting one list inside another list item

A list is nested when:
    - A <ul> or <ol> is placed inside an <li>

This is used when items have sub-items

Real-life Example:
    -Fruits
        - Apple
        - Banana
    - Vegetables
        - Carrot
        - Potato

2. What is indentation
    - Indentation is the spacing (tabs or spaces) used in your HTML code to show structure and hierarchy.

Important:
    - Indentation is for humans, not browsers
    - Browsers ignore indentation
    - Improves readability and debugging

3. Nesting vs Indentation (Difference)

    Feature                 Nesting                     Indentation
    What it is              HTML structure              Code formatting
    Affects output          Yes                         No
    Purpose                 Create sub-lists            Makes code readable

4. Correct Nesting Rule
    - A nested list must be inside an <li>, not directly inside <ul> or <ol>.
    Correct concept (no code):
        - <ul>
            - <li> Item 1
                - <ul>
                    - <li> Sub-item
            - <li> Item 2
    
    Wrong concept:
        - <ul>
            - <ul> (must be inside <li>)

5. Why Nesting is important
    - Organizes complex information
    - Used in menus and navigation
    - Improves accessibility
    - Reflects real-world hierarchy

Simple Summary:
    - Nesting = list inside a list item
    - Indentation = spacing to show structure in code
    - Nesting affects how the list appears
    - Indentation helps developers understand the code
