What is the Anchor Element?
    - The anchor element (<a>) is used to create links (hyperlinks) in a webpage.
    - It allows users to navigate between gaps, sections, files, or external websites.

Basic Purpose:
    The anchor element connects:
        - One webpage to another
        - One section of a page to another section
        - A webpage to a file (PDF, image)
        - A webpage to an email or phone action

Key Attribute: href
    - href = Hypertext Reference
    - It specifies where the link goes
    Without href, the anchor is not a clickable link.

Common Types of Links
1. External Links - goes to another website
2. Internal Links - goes to another page in the same site
3. Anchor (section) link - jumps to a specific section on the same page
4. Email Link - opens the user's email app
5. Phone Link - starts a call on supported devices.

Important Anchor Attributes

Anchor Text
    The anchor text is the clickable part of the link.

        - "Read More"

Accessibility Tips
