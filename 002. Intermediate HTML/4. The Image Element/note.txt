What Is the Image Element?
The image element (<img>) is used to display images on a webpage.

It is a self-closing (void) element, meaning:
    - It does not have a closing tag
    - All information is provided through attributes


Main Purpose
    - Show photos, icons, logos, and graphics
    - Enhance content visually
    - Support branding and user experience

Essential Attributes
    - src (source) – path or URL of the image
    - alt (alternative text) – text shown if the image fails to load and read by screen readers

    📌 The image will not display without src
    📌 alt is required for accessibility

Why alt Is Important
    - Helps visually impaired users
    - Displays text if image is broken
    - Improves SEO
    - Required for accessibility standards

Image Formats Commonly Used
    - JPEG/JPG – photos
    - PNG – images with transparency
    - SVG – icons and logos (scalable)
    - WEBP – modern, smaller file size

Simple Summary
    - <img> displays images
    - It is self-closing
    - src shows where the image comes from
    - alt describes the image for accessibility
