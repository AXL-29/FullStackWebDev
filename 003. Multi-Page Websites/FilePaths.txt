Multi-page Website - is a website made up of separate HTML files, where each page loads independently when the user clicks a link.

File path - is the address or location of a file inside a computer or website folder.
            it tells the browser where to find a file like an image, CSS, or another HTML page.

Relative File Path
    - Path based on the current file's location
    - Most commonly used in websites

    Examples:
        - css/style.css -> go into css folder
        - images/logo.png -> go into images folder
        - ../index.html -> go up one folder
    
Absolute File Path
    - Full path starting from the root
    - Rarely used in local websites

    Examples:
        - C:/Users/Jade/Desktop/website/index.html
        - /images/logo.png (root-based on a server)
