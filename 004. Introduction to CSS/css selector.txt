CSS Selector - used to select (target) HTML elements that you want to style.

Why CSS Selectors are important:
    - They control where styles apply.
    - They help you design specific parts of a webpage
    - They prevent styles from affecting the wrong elements.

Basic Type of CSS Selectors
    1. Element Selector
        - Target all elements of a specific Type

        Example idea:
            - Select all paragraph
            - Select all headings

        Example use:
        p {
            CSS code
        }

        h1 {
            CSS code
        }
        
        Used when you want every element of that type to look the same.

    2. Class Selector
        - Target elements with a specific class attribute.
            - Starts with a dot (.)
            - Can be used on multiple elements

        Example Idea:
        - Style all the items with class highlights

        Example use:
        .class-name {
            CSS code
        }

        Best for reusable styles.

    3. ID Selector
    Target one unique element.
        - Starts with a hash (#)
        - Must be unique on the page

    Example Idea:
        - Style a single header or section

    Example use:
        #id-name {
            CSS code
        }
    
    Used for one specific element only.

    4. Group Selector
    Target multiple elements at once.
    
    Example idea:
        - Style all headings the same way
    
    This helps reduce repetition in your styles.

    5. Descendant Selector
    Target elements inside another element.

    Example Idea:
        - Style only link inside a navigation bar
    
    Very useful for structured layouts.
