Introduction to CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the language used to style and design web pages. 
While HTML gives structures (headings, paragraphs, images), CSS controls how they look-colors, fonts, spacing, layout and resposiveness.

Why use CSS?
    - Design and Appearance - colors, fonts, backgrounds
    - Layout Control - spacing, alignment, positioning
    - Responsive Design - works on desktop, tablet, mobile
    - Reusability - style many pages with one stylesheet
    - Separation of Concerns - HTML = structure, CSS = style

How CSS Works (Basic Idea)
    CSS targets HTML elements using selectors and applies rules to them.

    Rule structure (conceptual):
        - Selector -> which HTML element to style
        - Property -> what do you want to change
        - Value -> how you want it to look

    Example (concept only, not code-heavy):
        - Select a paragraph
        - Change its text color to blue

Ways to Apply CSS
    1. Inline CSS - style written directly inside an HTML element
    2. Internal CSS - style placed inside a <style> tag in the HTML file.
    3. External CSS (Best Practice) - styles written in a separate .css file and linked to HTML

    External CSS is preferred because it's clean, reusable, and scalable.

Common Things You Style with CSS
    - Text: font size, color, alignment
    - Boxes: width, height, padding, margin, border
    - Layout: flexbox, grid
    - Effects: hover, transitions, animations

The CSS Box Model (Very Important)
    Every HTML element is treated as a box:
    - Content - text or image
    - Padding - space inside the box
    - Border - edge of the box
    - Margin - space outside the box
