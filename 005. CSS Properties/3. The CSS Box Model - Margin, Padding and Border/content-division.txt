Content Division element refers to the HTML div element.

A div (division) is a generic container used to group other element HTML elements together so they can be styled or arranged using CSS.

What does a div Do?
    - It has no visual appearance by default
    - It does not add meaning to the content.
    - It is mainly used for:
        - Layout 
        - Grouping elements
        - Styling with CSS
        - Structuring a webpage

    Think of it as an invisible box.

Why is it called "Content Division"?
    Because it divides the page into sections or blocks of content.

    Example ideas:
        - A header area
        - A card container
        - A side bar
        - A footer section

Key Characteristics of div

Feature                         Description

Display type                    Block-level element
Visible by default              No

Used for                        Layout and Grouping

div vs Symantic Elements
    While div is useful, modern HTML also has semantic elements like:
        - header
        - nav
        - section
        - article
        - footer

    Rule of thumb:
        - Use semantic element when the content has meaning
        - Use div when you just need a container for styling or layout.

How div works with CSS
    CSS is where the div becomes powerful:
        - Add background colors
        - Control width and height
        - Apply padding, margin, and borders
        - Use Flexbox or Grid for layout.
    Without CSS, a div does nothing visually.
