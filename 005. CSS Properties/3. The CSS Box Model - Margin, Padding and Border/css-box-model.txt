The CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding, and Border

What is the CSS Box Model?

In CSS, every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box.
The CSS Box Model explains how space and size are calculated around that element.

It is made up of four layers:
1. Content
2. Padding
3. Border
4. Margin

1. Content
    - The actual content of the element
    - This is where text, images, or videos appear
    - Width and height usually apply to this area.

    Think of it as the core of the box.

2. Padding (Inner Space)
    - Space betweeen the content and the border
    - Increases the inside space of the element
    - Padding is inside the box

    Example idea:
    - Add space so text doesn't touch the border
    - Padding affects element size

3. Border (Edge)
    - Surrounds the padding and content
    - Has width, style and color
    - Border adds to the total size of the element

    Example idea:
    - A solid black outline around a card
    - Border counts toward total size

    They define the thickness, style, color and shape of that line.

    Core Border Properties
    1. border-width
        - Controls how thick the border is
        - Can be thin, medium, thick, or a specific size.

        Thicker borders make elements stand out more.

    2. border-style (Required)
        - Defines how the border looks.
        - Common values:
            - solid     - straight line
            - dashed    - broken line
            - dotted    - dots
            - double    - two lines
            - none      - no border
        
        No border will appear without a style, even if width and color are set.

    3. border-color
        - Set the color of the border
        - Can use color names, HEX, RGB, etc.

        Example idea:
            - Black border
            - Blue outline
            - Red warning box

    Shorthand Border Property
    - Instead of writing width, style, and color separately, you can combine them:
    
    Concept:
    border: width style color;

    This is cleaner and commonly used.

    Side-Specific Border Properties
    You can style each side differently:
    - border-top
    - border-right
    - border-bottom
    - border-left

    Example idea:
    - Only underline an element using a bottom border.

    Rounded Borders
    4. border-radius
        - Rounds the corners of a border
        - Higher values = more rounded
        - Can create:
            - Rounded cards
            - Pills
            - Circles (with equal width and height)

4. Margin (Outer Space)
    - Space outside the border
    - Creates distance betweeen elements
    - Margin is transparent

    Example idea:
    - Add space betweeen two sections
    - Margin does not affect element size, only the spacing around it.
