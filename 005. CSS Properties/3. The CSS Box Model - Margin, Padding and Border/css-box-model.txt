The CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding, and Border

What is the CSS Box Model?

In CSS, every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box.
The CSS Box Model explains how space and size are calculated around that element.

It is made up of four layers:
1. Content
2. Padding
3. Border
4. Margin

1. Content
    - The actual content of the element
    - This is where text, images, or videos appear
    - Width and height usually apply to this area.

    Think of it as the core of the box.

2. Padding (Inner Space)
    - Space betweeen the content and the border
    - Increases the inside space of the element
    - Padding is inside the box

    Example idea:
    - Add space so text doesn't touch the border
    - Padding affects element size

3. Border (Edge)
    - Surrounds the padding and content
    - Has width, style and color
    - Border adds to the total size of the element

    Example idea:
    - A solid black outline around a card
    - Border counts toward total size

4. Margin (Outer Space)
    - Space outside the border
    - Creates distance betweeen elements
    - Margin is transparent

    Example idea:
    - Add space betweeen two sections
    - Margin does not affect element size, only the spacing around it.
