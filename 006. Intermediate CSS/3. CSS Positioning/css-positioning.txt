CSS Positioning controls where an element is placed on the page and how it behavess relative to other elements.

You set it using position property.

position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky;

1. position: static (DEFAULT)
    .box {
        position: static;
    }

    - default for all elements
    - follows normal document flow
    - top, left, right, bottom do NOT work
    
    Use Case: Almost everything by default

2. position: relative

    .box {
        position: relative;
        top: 10px;
        left: 20px;
    }

    - moves relative to its original position
    - still keeps its space in the layout
    - creates a position context for children

    Use Case:
    - Small nudges
    - Parent for absolute elements

3. position: absolute

    .child {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
    }

    - removed from normal flow
    - positioned relative to nearest position ancestor
    - if no positioned parent -> relative to <body>

    Requires:
    .parent {
        position: relative;
    }

    Use Case:
    - Dropdown
    - Tooltips
    - Badges/icons on cards

4. position: fixed
    .navbar {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
    }

    - positioned relative to viewport
    - does NOT move when scrolling
    - removed from normal flow

    Use case:
    - sticky headers
    - floating buttons
    - chat widgets

5. position: sticky;
    .headers {
        position: sticky;
        top: 0;
    }
    - Acts like relative until scroll
    - then acts like fixed
    - needs a top, left, etc. to work

    Won't work if:
    - parent has overflow: hidden

    Use Case:
    - Section headers
    - Tables
    - Side menus

Position Offsets
    Used with relative, absolute, fixed, sticky:
        - top, right, bottom, left

6. z-index (Stacking Order)
    .modal {
        position: fixed;
        z-index: 1000;
    }

    - higher number -> on top
    - works only on positioned elements
    - affected by stacking context

    - avoid huge numbers like 99999

Best Practices
DO's
- Use Flexbox / Grid for layout
- Use position for fine control

Dont's
- Don't build full layout with absolute
- Avoid magic numbers (top: 347px)
