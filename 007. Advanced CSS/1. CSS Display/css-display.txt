CSS Display

The display property controls how an element is rendered on the page
and how it interacts with other elements. It's one of the most important CSS properties for layout.

Common display Values

1. display: block
    - Takes full width
    - Starts on a new line

    Behavior:
    - Width & height work
    - Margin & padding work on all sides

    Think: Big boxes stacked vertically

2. display: inline
    - Takes only the content width
    - Stays on the same line

    Behavior:
    - Width & height don't work
    - Top & bottom margin ignored.

    Think: Text-like elements

3. display: inline-block
    - Stays inline
    - Accept width, height, margin, padding

    Use when:
    - buttons
    - badges
    - inline cards

    Think: Inline but box-styled

4. display: none
    - Element is completely removed from layout.
    - No space occupied

    Different from visibility: hidden
    - hidden = invisible but still takes space.

5. display: flex
    - Used for 1-dimensional layouts (row OR column)

    Key abilities:
    - Align items horizontally & vertically
    - Control spacing easily

    Common properties:
    - justify-content
    - align-items
    - flex-direction

    Think: Flexible row or column layout

6. display: grid
    - Used for 2-dimensional layout (rows AND columns)

    Power features:
    - Precise layout control
    - Complex designs made simple

    Think: Table-like but modern and responsive

7. display: table (less common)
    - Mimics table behavior without using <table>
