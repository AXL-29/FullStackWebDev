What is CSS float?

The float property is used to push an element to the left or right of its container,
allowing text or inline elements to wrap around it.

It was originally designed to wrapping text around images, not for full page layout.

Basic Values
    - float: left;
    - float: right;
    - float: none; (default)

How float Works
When an element is floated:
    - It is taken out of the normal document flow
    - It moves to the left or right
    - Other content wraps around it

    Think of a newspaper image with text flowing beside it.

Common Use Case (Classic)
Image floating inside text:

    img {
        float: left;
        margin-right: 10px;
    }

    Result:
    - Image stick to the left
    - Text wraps around the image

Problem with float (Important)
1. Parent Collapse
    - A floated element does not increase the height of its parent.
    - This causes layout breaking.

2. Clearing Floats
    - To fix the collapse, you use clear.

    .clearfix::after {
        content: "";
        display: block;
        clear: both;
    }

clear Property
Used to stop elements from wrapping around floats.

    - clear: left;
    - clear: right;
    - clear: both;

Why float is NOT recommended for layout today.
    - hard to manage
    - breaks layout easily
    - requires clearfix hacks

    Fleaxbox and Grid replaced it.

When should you still use float?
    - Text wrapping around images.
    - Legacy projects
    - Very simple alignment cases.
