How to create a responsive website

A responsive website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). 
in modern CSS, this is a must-have skill.

1. Use a mobile-first approach
    - Start designing for small screens first, then scale up.

    Why?

    - Mobile users are the majority.
    - Easier to add features than remove them.

    /* Mobile default */
    body {
        font-size: 16px;
    }

2. Use Flexible Layouts (Flexbox & Grid)
    Flexbox (1D Layouts)
    .container {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap ;
    }

    Grid(2D Layouts)
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    }

    These automatically adjust based on screen width.

3. Use responsive unit (NOT fixed pixels)

    Avoid:
    width: 500px

    Use:
    width: 100px
    max-width: 1200px;

    Best units:
    - % -> relative to parent
    - vw, vh -> viewport based
    - rem, em -> scalable typography

4. Media Queries (Core of Responsiveness)
    Media queries apply style based on screen size.

    @media (min-width: 768px) {
        .container {
            display: flex;
        }
    }

    Common Breakpoint (Guide)

    Device              Width
    Mobile              < 768px
    Tablet              >= 768px
    Desktop             >= 1024px

5.  Responsive Images

    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

    Prevents iamges from overflowing their containers.

6. Use the viewport meta tag (Very Important)

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    Without this,  mobile responsiveness will not work properly.

7. Avoid Old Techniques

    Don't Use:
    - float for layouts
    - fixed-width container
    - tables for page structure

8. Test on Multiple screens
    
    Use:
    - Browser DevTools (responsive mode)
    - Resize the browser window
    - Real mobile devices if possible
