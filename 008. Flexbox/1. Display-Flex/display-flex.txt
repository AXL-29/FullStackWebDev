Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout system designed to help you arrange items in one direction
at a time - either row or column - and make layout responsive and easy to align.

Common Flexbox Properties

1. display: flex;
    - to an element, you turn it into a flex container

    What actually happens?
    1. The element becomes a flex container
        - Its direct children become flex items
    2. Items line up in a row by default
        -  Default direction is horizontal (row)
    3. Items stop behaving like normal block elements.
        - No more full-width stacking
        - They align side-by-side.

    Default behavior after display: flex;
    - Without adding anything else, Flexbox already applies these  defaults:

    property                            default value
    flex-direction                      row
    justify-content                     flex-start
    align-items                         stretch
    flex-wrap                           nowrap

    Meaning:
    - Items go left or right
    - Start vertically to match container height
    - Stay on one line

    Simple example (conceptual)
    before:
        - divs stack top to bottom
    after display: flex;
        - divs line up side by side

    Why display: flex; is powerful
    With just one line, you can:
        - Align items horizontally or vertically
        - Center items easily
        - Control spacing
        - Make layouts responsive

    Example ideas (no code needed):
        - Center a login form
        - Create a navbar
        - Arrange  cards in a row

    Important notes:
        - Only direct children areo affected
        - It works on the container, not the items
        - It replaces old layout hacks like float

    Think of it like this:
        display: flex; says:
        "Hey container, manage your children intelligently."
