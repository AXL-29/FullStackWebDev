flex-basis - defines the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking happens.

Think of it as:
    "How big should this item start?"

What flex-basis really does
    - It sets the default width or height of a flex-direction:
    - Which one it affects depends on flex-direction:
        - row       ->  affects width
        - column    ->  affects height

    So:
    - row       -> flex-basis = width
    - column    -> flex-basis = height

    Common values
    - auto (default)
        - Size is based on content or width / height
    - px, %, em, etc.
        - Example: 200px
    - 0
        - Ignore content size, distribute space evenly.

    Example Scenario (no code)
    Imagine 3 boxes in a row:
        - Box A = flex-basis: 100px
        - Box B = flex-basis: 200px
        - Box C = flex-basis: 300px

    Before any resizing:
        - Box C starts the largest
        - Box A starts the smallest

    Then:
        - flex-grow decides how extra space is shared
        - flex-shrink decides how space is reduced

    flex-basis vs width
    
    Important difference:
    - flex-basis overrides width when Flexbox is active
    - Flexbox sizing logic uses flex-basis first

    Rule of thumb:
    - If you're using Flexbox, prefer flex-basis over width

    Relationship with flex shorthand
    Most of the time you'll see:

    flex: grow shrink basis;

    Example:
    flex: 1 1 200px

    Meaning:
    - Start at 200px
    - Can grow
    - Can shrink
