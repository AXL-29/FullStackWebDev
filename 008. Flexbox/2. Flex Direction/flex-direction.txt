What is flex-direction?

flex-direction controls the direction in which flex items are laid out insidie a flex container.
it decides where items start, when they go, and what the main axis is.

The 4 values of flex-direction

1.  row (default)
    - Items go left -> right
    - Main axis: horizontal
    - Cross axis: vertical
    
    This is what happens automatically after display: flex;

2. row-reverse
    - Items go right -> left
    - Main axis is still horizontal
    - Order is reverse

    Visual order changes, HTML order does not.

3. column
    - Items go top -> bottom
    - Main axis: vertical
    - Cross axis: horizontal

    Common for:
    - Sidebars
    - Vertical menus
    - Forms

4. column-reverse
    - Items go bottom -> top
    - Main axis is vertical
    - Order is reversed

Visual summary
Value	        Direction	    Main Axis
row	                →	        Horizontal
row-reverse	        ←	        Horizontal
column	            ↓	        Vertical
column-reverse  	↑	        Vertical

Why flex-direction is important
It affects:
    - justify-content (works on the main axis)
    - align-items (works on the cross axis)

Example:
    - row -> justify-content = horizontal alignment
    - column -> justify-content = vertical alignment

    This is where beginners usually get confused

Easy way to remember
    flex-direction = "Which way do my items flow?"

    row = across
    column = down

Pro Tip:
    If you want to:
    - Center vertically -> use column
    - Center horizontally -> use row

    Then apply justify-content and align-items accordingly.
