Flex Layout (Flexbox)

A flex layout (also called Flexbox) is a CSS layout system used to arrange, align, and
distribute  space among items inside a container in one direction at a time (row or column).

It makes layout responsive, flexible, and much easier than older methods like float.

Core idea of Flex Layout
Flex layout works using:
    - Flex container -> the parent element
    - Flex items -> the direct children

When you set:

    display: flex;

    You activate the flex layout.

What Flex Layout is good at
    - Lining items horizontally or vertically
    - Centering elements (both directions)
    - Controlling spacing between items
    - Making layouts adapt to screen size
    - Building UI components (navbars, cards, forms)

How Flex Layout works (conceptually)
    1. Items follow main axis
        - Controlled by flex-direction
    2. Items align across a cross axis
    3. Space is distributed automatically
    4. Items can grow or shrink as needed.

Common Properties
1. justify-content (JUSTIFY)
    - Controls spacing and alignment on the MAIN axis
    - The main axis depends on flex-direction

    Common Values:
        - flex-start    - items at the start
        - center        - items centered
        - flex-end      - items at the end
        - space-between - space between items
        - space-around  - space around items
        - space-evenly  - equal space everywhere

        If flex-direction: row;
        -> justify-content works horizontally

        If flex-direction: column;
        -> justify-content works vertically

2. align-items (ALIGN)
    - Controls alignment on the CROSS axis
    - Cross axis is always perpendicular to the main axis

    Common Values:
        - stretch(default)      - items stretch to fill
        - center                - center items
        - flex-start            - align to start
        - flex-end              - align to end
        - baseline              - align text baselines

        If flex-direction: row
        -> align-items works vertically

        If flex-direction: column
        -> align-items works horizontally

3. flex-wrap (WRAP)
    - Conrols whether items stay on one line or move to a new line

    Values:
    - nowrap(default)   - single line
    - wrap              - items move to next line
    - wrap-reverse      - wrap but reversed order

    Useful for:
    - Responsive cards
    - Navigation menus
    - Grids without Grid

How they work together

Assume:
    - flex-direction: row

    | Property          | Controls     |
    | ----------------- | ------------ |
    | `justify-content` | Left ↔ Right |
    | `align-items`     | Up ↕ Down    |
    | `flex-wrap`       | New lines    |

Change to:
    - flex-direction

    | Property          | Controls     |
    | ----------------- | ------------ |
    | `justify-content` | Up ↕ Down    |
    | `align-items`     | Left ↔ Right |

Easy memory trick
    - justify = main direction
    - align   = cross direction
    - wrap    = next line or not

4. align-self
    - align-self lets ONE flex item control its own alignment, overriding the container's align-items

    Common Values:
    - auto (default)    -> follows align-items
    - flex-start        -> align to start
    - center            -> center itself
    - flex-end          -> align to end
    - stretch           -> stretch itself
    - baseline          -> align text baseline
