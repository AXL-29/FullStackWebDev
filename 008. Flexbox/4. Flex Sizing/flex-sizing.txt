Flex Sizing is how Flexbox decides how big each flex item should be inside a flex container.

The 3 properties that control the flex sizing
1. flex-basis -> starting size
    - The item's initial size before space is distributed
    - In row -> width
    - In column -> height

2. flex-grow -> grow if there's extra space
    - Controls how much an item expands
    - 0 -> don't grow
    - 1 -> grow equally
    - 2 -> grow twice as much

3. flex-shrink -> shrink if space is tight
    - Controls how much an item shrinks
    - 1 -> shrink normally (default)
    - 0 -> don't shrink

The flex shorthand (very common)
Most layouts use:

    flex: grow shrink basis;

Example:

    flex: 1 1 200px

Meaning:
- Start at 200px
- Can grow
- Can shrink

How flex sizing works (step-by-step)
    1. Browser looks at flex-basis
    2. Compares total item size with container size
    3. Extra space -> distributed using flex-grow
    4. Not enough space -> reduce using flex-shrinks

flex-sizing vs width / height

| Property           | Flex sizing |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `width` / `height` | Fixed       |
| `flex-basis`       | Flexible    |
| `flex-grow/shrink` | Adaptive    |
