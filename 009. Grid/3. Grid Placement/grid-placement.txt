What is grid placement?

Grid placement is how you decide where a grid item sits inside the grid:
    - which row
    - which column
    - how many cells it spans

    Instead of items flowing automatically, you place them intentionally.

    Automatic placement (default)

    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    }

    Items fill the grid left -> right, top -> bottom

    Manual grid placement (core properties)
    1. grid-column
        - Controls horizontal placement

        .item {
            grid-column: 1/3;
        }

        Meaning:
        - Start at column line 1
        - End at column line 3
        - Span 2 columns

    2. grid-row
        - Controls vertical placement

        .item {
            grid-row: 1/2;
        }

    3. Start / End syntax
        grid-column-start: 1;
        grid-column-end: 3;

        Same as:
        grid-column: 1/3;

    
    Using span (very common)

        .item {
            grid-column: span 2;
        }

        Takes up 2 columns wheree from where I start.

    Negative line numbers
        .item {
            grid-column: 1/ -1;
        }

        Means:
            - From first line
            - To last line
            - Great for full-width elements.

    Named areas (visual placement)
        grid-template-areas:
            "header header"
            "sidebar main";
        
        header {
            grid-area: header;
        }

        No numbers - just names.

    Overlapping items (yes, allowed)

    .item1 {
        grid-column: 1 / 3;
        grid-row: 1/2;
    }

    Items can overlap if you place them on the same cells.
