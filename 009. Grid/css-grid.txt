CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system for building row and columns with precision

display: grid;
tells the browser: "This element is now a Grid container"

Once you set this, all direct children become Grid items, and you can control their layout using rows and columns.

What it enables
With display: grid;, you can:
    - Create rows and columns
    - Control spacing both horizontally and vertically
    - Precisely place items anywhere in the layout

Example (Conceptually)
    - The container -> grid
    - Children -> arranged into cells
    - You decide:
        - how many columns
        - how tall rows are
        - how much gap exist between items.

Common Grid properties used after this
    - grid-template-columns -> define column structure
    - grid-template-rows    -> define row structure
    - gap   -> space between grid items
    - justify-items / align-items -> alinment inside cells

    -> Think of Grid like a table you fully control with CSS but way more flexible.
