What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a CSS framework (with optional JavaScript) that helps you build responsive, mobile-first websites faster.

Instead of writing tons of CSS from scratch, Bootstrap gives you:
    - Pre-made classes
    - A grid system
    - Ready-to-use components (buttons, navbars, cards, modals, etc.)

    -> You mostly write HTML + class names, not custom CSS.

Why use Bootstrap?
    - Faster development
    - Responsive by default
    - Consistent design
    - Beginner-friendly
    - Less CSS to maintain

Bootstrap is mainly made of:
    1. Grid System
    2. Utility Classes
    3. Components
    4. JavaScript Plugins

Let's go one by one

1. Bootstrap Grid System
    - Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid.

    Core idea:
        - Rows contain columns
        - Columns decide width

    Example Logic:
        - 12 columns    = full width
        - 6 columns     = half
        - 4 columns     = one-third

    Responsive sizes:
        - col- (extra-small)
        - col-sm- (small)
        - col-md- (medium)
        - col-lg- (large)
        - col-xl-  (extra large)

    So layouts automatically adapt to screen size.

2. Utility Classes
    - There are small helper classes that replace common CSS rules.

    Examples of what they control:
        - Spacing (margin, padding)
        - Text alignment
        - Colors
        - Display (flex, none, block)
        - Width & height

    Instead of writing CSS like:
        - margin-top: 16px;

    You just add a class.

3. Bootstrap Components
    - Pre-built UI pieces you can drop in instantly:
        - Buttons
        - Cards 
        - Navbars 
        - Forms 
        - Alerts 
        - Modals 
        - Dropdowns 
        - Pagination 

    They are:
        - Styled
        - Responsive
        - Accessible

    You can customize them later with your own CSS.

4. Bootstrap JavaScript
    Some components need JS to work:
        - Modals
        - Dropdowns
        - Carousels
        - Tooltips
    
    Bootstrap handles the logic for you, - you just activate them.

Mobile-First Design
    Bootstrap is mobile-first by default.

    That means:
        - Styles apply to small screens first
        - Large screen override when needed
    This is why responsive classes exist (md, lg, etc.)

    When SHOULD you use Bootstrap?
        - Prototypes
        - Dashboards
        - Admin panels
        - Fast MVPs
        - Beginners learning layout & responsiveness

    When NOT to use Bootstrap?
        - If you want a very unique design
        - If file size is critical
        - If you already mastered CSS framework like Tailwind
