What is a Bootstrap Layout?

    - A bootstrap layout is the structure of your page built using Bootstrap's grid system,
    containers, rows, and columns so your automatically adapts to different screen sizes.

    The 4 main parts of a Bootstrap Layout

    1. Container
        The outer wrapper of your page.

        Two types:
        - container -> fixed width (changes per screen size)
        - container-fluid -> full width (100% of screen)

    2. Row
        Rows are used to group columns horizontally.

        Rules:
            - Rows go inside containers
            - columns go inside rows
            - Rows help align columns properly
    
    3. Columns
        Columns control width

        Key Idea:
        - Bootstrap uses 12 columns per row
        - You divide those 12 to create layouts

        Example (conceptually):
        - 12 -> full width
        - 6 + 6 -> two equal columns
        - 4 + 4 + 4 -> three equal columns

        Columns are responsive, meaning they change sizes depending on screen size.

    4. Breakpoints (Responsive behavior)
        - Bootstrap layouts change based on screen size.

        Breakpoints:
        - Extra small (phones)
        - Small (tablets)
        - Medium (laptops)
        - Larg (desktops)
        - Extra large (big screens)

        You control when layout changes using these.
