Color Theory is the study of how colros work together and how they affect human emotions, perception, and design.

In web design, colour theory helps you:
    - Create visually appealing websites
    - Guide user attention
    - Improve readability
    - Influence emotions and decisions

1. The Color Wheel
    The color wheel is the foundation of color theory. It was developed by Isaac Newton when he organized colors into a circular diagram.

    It has three main types of colors:
        - Primary Colors
            - Red
            - Blue
            - Yellow
        These cannot be created by mixing other colors.

        - Secondary Colors
            - Green (Blue + Yellow)
            - Orange (Red + Yellow)
            - Purple (Red + Blue)

        - Tertiary Colors
            - Made by mixing primary + secondary colors.

2. Color Harmonies (Color Combinations)
    These are balanced combination of colors:
        
        Complementary
            - Color opposite each other on the wheel
            - Example: Blue & Orange
            - High contrast (great for buttons)

        Analogous
            - Colors next to each other
            - Example: Blue, Blue-Green, Green
            - Soft and harmonious

        Triadic
            - Three evenly spaced colors
            - Example: Red, Blue, Yellow
            - Balanced but vibrant

3. Warm vs Cool Colors
    
    Warm Colors
        - Red, Orange, Yellow
        - Energetic, passionate, exciting
    
    Cool Colors
        - Blue, Green, Purple
        - Calm, professional, trustworthy

4. Color Physcology in Web Design
    Colors Influence emotions:
        - Blue -> Trust, security (banks, tech companies)
        - Red -> Urgency, passion (sales, promotions)
        - Green -> Growth, health
        - Black -> Luxury, elegance
        - White -> Clean, simple
