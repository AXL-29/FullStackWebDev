Typography is the art and technique of arranging text so it is readable, clear, and visually appealing on website.

In web design, typography affects:
    - Readability
    - User experience
    - Branding
    - Professional look

1. What is a Font vs Typeface?
    - Typeface -> The design of the letters (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman)
    - Font -> The variation of a typeface (bold, italic, 16px, etc.)

    Example:
    Arial Bold 18px is a font of the Arial typeface

2. Main Font Categories
    
    Serif
    - Has small decorative strokes (feet)
    - Example: Times New Roman
    - Feels: Traditional, formal

    Sans-Serif
    - No decorative strokes
    - Example: Helvetica
    - Feels: Modern, clean (most websites use this)

    Monospace
    - Every letter has equal width
    - Example: Courier New
    - Used for code

    Script
    - Looks like handwriting
    - Elegant or decorative

3. Important Typography Properities in CSS
    Font Size
    - Controls text size

    Best practice:
        - Body text: 16px minimum
        - Headings: Larger for hierarchy

    Font Weight
        - 400 -> normal
        - 700 -> Bold

    Line Height
        - Controls spacing between lines
    
    Recommended: 1.5 for body text

    Letter spacing
        - Space between letters

4. Typography Hierarchy
    - Hierarchy guides users on what to read first

    Example Structure:

    - H1 -> Main Title
    - H2 -> Section Title
    - H3 -> Subsection
    - Paragraph -> Body text

    Good hierarchy = clean and organized design

5. Typography Best Practices for Web Design
    - Use only 2-3 fonts max
    - Use sans-serif for modern website
    - Maintain consistent spacing
    - Ensure good contrast (dark text on light background)
    - Don't make text too small

    - Bad typography = website feels unprofessional
    - Good typography = clean, modern, trustworthy

    Even simple website look premium with proper typography
