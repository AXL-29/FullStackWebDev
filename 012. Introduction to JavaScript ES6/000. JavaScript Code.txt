alert();
    - alert is a built-in function that shows a small popup message box in the browser.

    The function is:

    alert("Your message here");

    What it does:
        - Display a popup dialog
        - Shows a message
        - Has an OK button
        - Stops (pauses) the code until the user clicks OK

    Example:
    alert("Hello, Jade!");

    When this runs, the browser shows a popup with the message Hello, Jade!

When is it used?
    - Simple notification
    - Debugging (for beginners)
    - Testing if something works

But in real projectss, developers don't usually use alert() because:
    - It blocks the page
    - It looks outdated
    - It gives poor user experience

Instead, modern apps use:
    - Costum modal boxes (HTML + CSS)
    - Toast notifications
    - Console logs (console.log() for debugging)

prompt();
    - shows a popup box asking the user to enter input.

    Syntax
        prompt("Your message here");

    Example:
        let name = prompt("What is your name: ");
        alert("Hello, " + name);

    What happens?
    1. A popup appears with a message.
    2. The user types something.
    3. They click OK to cancel.
    4. The value they typed is returned as a string.

    With a Default Value
        let age = prompt("Enter your age:", "18");
    
    Here:
    - First argument -> message
    - Second argument -> default value

    Important Notes!
    - It always returns a string
    - If the user clicks Cancel, it returns null
    - It blocks the page until the user responds (like alert())
