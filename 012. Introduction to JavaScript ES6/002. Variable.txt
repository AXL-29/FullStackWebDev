Variable - is a container used to store data in memory so you can use it later in your programming.

Think of it like a labeled box:
    - The label = variable name
    - The content inside = value

Example:
    let name = "Jade"

    - name -> variable
    - "Jade" -> value stored inside the variable

    Now you can use it:
    console.log(name);

    Output:
    Jade

Why Variables Are Important
    Without variables
    - You cannot store user input
    - You cannot calculate values
    - You cannot build dynamic websites

    Example:
    let price = 100;
    let quantity = 3;
    let total = price * quantity;

    console.log(total)  // 300

Ways to Declare Variables (ES6)
    
    There are 3 ways:

    1. let (Modern & Flexible)
        Used when the value can change.

        let age = 25;
        age = 26;   // allowed
    
    2. const (Recommended by Default)
        Used when value should NOT change.

        const PI = 3.14;
        PI = 3.1416;    // Error

        Best Practice:
        - Used const by default
        - Used let if the value needs to change

    3. var (Old Way)

        var name = "Jade";

        - Avoid using var in modern JavaScript
        - It has scope issues.

Variable Naming Rules

    Must start with:
        - Letter
        - _ 
        - $

        Cannot start with number

    Valid:
    let userName;
    let _total;
    let $price;

    Invalid:
    let 1name;  // Error
